Upon hardware startup you will be greeted with a "Welcome" screen. Wait a few seconds. You will then be shown
a screen to put the board into "Receive" mode or into "Game" mode.

Pressing the "Up" button will place the board into "Receive" mode and pressing the "Down" button will place the
board into "Game" mode.

Game mode:

You will be shown a screen that confirms your selection and instructions on how to play. When you see an arrow
with an action the game will have begun and you must be quick to follow the commands. If you make a mistake or
reach 50 points, the game will end and you'll be shown your high scores. If you're playing with another player,
they will be able to see your score and increase or decrease your difficulty. When the game has ended press the 
onboard "reset" button to play again!

Receive Mode:

When you pressed the "down" button you will be shown a confirmation screen. When your friend has begun to play
you will be able to see their score increment. Here you will be able to press the "up" button to increase the
time they have to make a move or by pressing the "down" button you will be able to decrease the time they
have to make a move. The high scores will be shown when they finish and they may be able to knock you off your
own score board!
